1. Team Members: Dan Baluan, Terrill Leaton, Jordan Baumchen


2. The main learning objective for this project was to apply knowledge that we had learned through the semester from our Programming II class by developing a website for the Kansas State Polytechnic TWIST Program. This was meant to enable the students to sign up and make available easier management tools of the website for the administrators/planners of this event.


3. I contributed to the detail functions of the room, session, and topic controllers.
4. I did not encounter any particular issues besides the vulnerability issues our group previously encountered.
5. I am not sure what needs to be completed further.
6. I would take the knowledge I have gained from this project and use it.
